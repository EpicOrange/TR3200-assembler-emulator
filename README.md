TR3200 Assembler and VM
=========================
This is an assembler and VM for the TR3200 cpu. ([specs](https://github.com/trillek-team/trillek-computer/blob/master/cpu/TR3200.md))  
*The current version only implements the instructions SLEEP and MOV, and still needs a lot of work in general.*  
*However the assembler should be able to assemble all instructions.*  

You can try it out [here](http://epicorange.github.io/TR3200-assembler-emulator).

NOTE: The thing with arrows is dysfunctional at the moment.
